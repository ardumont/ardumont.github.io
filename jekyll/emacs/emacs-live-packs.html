Here is a small article about why I love emacs-live.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> is a powerful text editor.
</p>

<p>
So what the fuss is all about?
</p>

<p>
Simply put, I'm a programmer (developer or whatever).
what I love doing is create applications (yes I'm an artist :D or at least I want to be).
</p>

<p>
What applications are, are really text.
Text, which is then transformed into bits and pieces that a computer can interpret accordingly to interact with the end-users.
</p>

<p>
So, really, emacs is now my predilection choice to develop.
</p>

<p>
If you setup emacs correctly, you do not have any need for army wars machines IDE (like eclipse, intellij-idea, netscape or whatever).
But, the setup is really the tricky part.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">emacs-live</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
So why <a href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live">emacs-live</a>?
</p>

<p>
As the <a href="http://overtone.github.io/emacs-live/">developers of emacs-live</a> put it, <a href="https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live">emacs-live</a> is an opinionated set of defaults for getting started with a specific focus on live coding with <a href="http://github.com/overtone/overtone">Overtone</a> and <a href="http://github.com/quil/quil">Quil</a>.
</p>

<p>
But, fortunately, it's not limited to that.
</p>

<p>
They made some choices that are way ok for me.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">emacs-live-packs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
So why <a href="https://github.com/ardumont/emacs-live-packs">emacs-live-packs</a> then?
</p>

<p>
emacs-live is a really great tools that extends really well emacs but it's way lisp oriented (clojure, overtone, common, emacs-lisp&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
As usual emacs users, when using emacs, add their own snippets of code that extend emacs.
</p>

<p>
As I became more experienced with emacs-lisp and emacs-live (every day and still learning), I added the emacs-live way, new snippets.
</p>

<p>
Those snippets became more and more organized and finally became emacs-live packs.
