<p>
Completely mind blowing video from Rich Hickey (<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>'s creator) where he exposes the limitations of the overall most popular actual languages.

<p>
Here's the link. I do not enter much in the details here as Rich Hikey himself is so good at explaining.

It's not about <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, which is the mere implementation of what this video is all about.

Be open-minded, sit back and enjoy!
