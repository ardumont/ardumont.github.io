When I find myself in times of trouble

Mother Mary comes to me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

And in my hour of darkness
             Em                     C
She is standing right in front of me

Living in the world agree,

There will be an answer, let it be.
         G                             D
For though they may be parted there is
Em                         C
Still a chance that they will see

There will be an answer, let it be.
