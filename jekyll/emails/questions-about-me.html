<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I made my studies at university when I first encountered functional programming with caml.
I did not realize the power that was given to the programmer.
</p>

<p>
Then, 2 years ago, I met clojure and overall the world of lisp (emacs-lisp, common-lisp, etc&#x2026;).
I am a linuxian since my university years but did not realise the power of lisp (we can only concentrate on so much
things at once&#x2026;) .
</p>

<p>
As yoda says, I unlearned everything I knew and embraced clojure's philosophy (simplicity matters, value of values,
incidental complexities no more, etc&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
I understood then the power of clojure and functional programming.
I unfortunately do not program in clojure in my professional carreer yet (java, scripting languages as I orient myself
towards the devops movements)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The only remote experience I have is working with one of my friend remotely with ssh, tmux (screen and byobu before),
emacs, gtalk or g+ on small clojure programs for almost 1,5 years.
</p>

<p>
We are on the same timezone though.

<h3 id="sec-3-2">and what skills would you like to develop?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Communication skills.
</p>

<p>
I already did some presentations (hands-on and other presentations but no video unfortunately) for french people (in
java community) to introduce them to clojure.
But I'm mitigated on the results. I must still work on my communication skills.
</p>

<p>
With a friend, we also animate the clojure-paris-user-group where we presents and soon we will code altogether.

<h2 id="sec-4">Q 4: What experience do you have in analytics, law, or search engines that might apply to what Cicayda does?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
None.
That's why interests me the most.
Things I do not know and must learn to reach a goal.

<h2 id="sec-5">Q 5: What are your core guiding philosophies when building software?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
All are importants to me and are at the same level:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>simplicity
</li>
<li>agility, iterative building
</li>
<li>testing
</li>
<li>quality
</li>
<li>maintenability
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Q 6: If you were to choose your ideal programming environment what would it be and why?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>dynamic, repl
</li>
<li>functional languages (clojure, haskell&#x2026;) where the simplicity is at the heart of the philosophy
</li>
<li>emacs (dev, organisation, etc&#x2026;), anything that can support extensions and dynamism and tweaks.
</li>
<li>git
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To sum up, the environment's got to adapt to you and not the other way around.
