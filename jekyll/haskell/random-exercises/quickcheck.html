I love to develop. The applications, the design, the performance, etc&#x2026;, it's fun.
</p>

<p>
But then I also need to test the application, to ensure that this does what I think it does.
</p>

<p>
So I develop the application then for testing the application, I develop the unit/integration tests&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But then again, what has all in common the applications that crashed in production?
It passes the tests!!! (go see <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">Rich Hickey's videos, it's way fun</a>).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, we also develop the tests, so let me ask this, who's gonna test the tests? and then&#x2026; the tests of the tests&#x2026; and&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Another solution could be to generate some of the integration tests.
