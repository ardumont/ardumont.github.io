Welcome to my blog.
</p>

<p>
I am @ardumont on <a href="https://github.com/ardumont">github</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ardumont">twitter</a>.
</p>

<p>
I develop software and contribute to multiple <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free/libre ones</a> on my spare time.
</p>

<p>
Here you will find my notes on multiple subjects that I came across at some point.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, these are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>notes
</li>
<li>articles
</li>
<li>to reproduce some advanced automation I keep forgetting.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
With a little luck, this could help others too.
