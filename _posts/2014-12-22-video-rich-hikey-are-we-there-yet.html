excerpt: Understanding Rich Hickey's vision about existing languages
---
<p>
Completely mind blowing video from Rich Hickey (<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>'s creator) where he exposes the limitations of the overall mainstream languages.
</p>

<p>
I do not enter much into the details here as Rich Hikey himself is so good at explaining it.
</p>

<p>
It's not about <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, which is the mere implementation of what this video is all about.
</p>

<p>
Be open-minded, sit back and enjoy!
