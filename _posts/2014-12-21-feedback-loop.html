<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Use the right tools for the right job. And feedback all the way!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">DISCLAIMER</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I present my set of tools.
</p>

<p>
In no way do I claim these are the supreme tools. As always, your mileage may vary.
</p>

<p>
The only claim I make is that they make me fast.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
As I already explains time and time again (links to add), I'm feedback driven.
</p>

<p>
I want to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>have feedback immediately after I executed a command/function
</li>
<li>know if I'm wrong now, not later
</li>
<li>believe&#x2026; (oops, bad context)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Why?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Because ideas are as fast as poping out of nowhere as disappearing into nowhere&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, it's right to think and think again and go implementing later&#x2026;
And sometimes, it's better to go think and tinker along the way too&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I believe that this feedback loop is the very nature of mouvements like:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>agility (as in `small sprint to show rapidly to the users something that works`)
</li>
<li>devops (as in `reproducible environment as soon as possible to avoid later trouble`)
</li>
<li>tests culture (as in `testing the runtime now and not when the application will be deployed)
</li>
<li>etc&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'd need to revisit this video but what at some point showed me I was hitting in the right direction was this particular video: <a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Bref Victor - Inventing on principles</a> and some consequences it had.
</p>

<p>
 As a result, <a href="https://twitter.com/ibdknox">Chris Granger</a> reacted immediately (it appeared as much to me) and came up the very next day with an equivalent demo in <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">clojurescript</a>.
Then some time after that, <a href="https://twitter.com/ibdknox">Chris Granger</a> came up with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table">LightTable</a>, to try and exercise what he thought was possible.
</p>

<p>
And <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table">Lighttable</a> showed a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>, an instarepl - As you type along your clojure(script) expression, you have immediately the result.
FEEDBACK!.
</p>

<p>
It is an awesome idea which embraces further the notion of feedback.

<h2 id="sec-5">How</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Here is my non-exhaustive list of tools I use to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> and now more specifically <a href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stable, user-friendly, extendable, reproducible&#x2026;
These are unavoidable qualities.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU/Emacs</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's not an editor, it's an environment extremely extendable.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm">StumpWM</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <b>emacs</b> like window manager!
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> I switched to XMonad but I'd recommend anyone to give it a try.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://xmonad.org/">XMonad</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In a graphical world, one has to display graphical software and what a pain it is to manually place windows.
XMonad takes care of this for me. What a nice dude!
</p>

<p>
Also I kept the way I called my applications from the stumpwm window manager (that is, I use a prefix key, `C-;` then another binding and this triggers the run or raise action for the particular application).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://orgmode.org">Org-mode</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To do things, one has to organized
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="//Tmux.Sourceforge.Net/">Tmux</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <b>emacs</b> terminal session manager!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> with <a href="https://github.com/mooz/keysnail">KeySnail</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Firefox, the emacs way!
</p>

<p>
No mouse (as much as possible, unfortunately, some site use some shitty js/css thingy that force the user to use his/her mouse)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Versioning every bit of data!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> / <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a> / <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Virtualize or test in sandbox environment!
