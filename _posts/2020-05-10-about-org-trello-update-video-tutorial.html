<p>
The <a href="https://org-trello.github.io">documentation</a> has been updated alongside features and fixes. But the <a href="https://org-trello.github.io/demo.html">video
tutorials</a> remained the same.
</p>

<p>
It has been <a href="https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/136">in my mind for a while (~ 5 years or so)</a>. Lots of cogs changed over
that period (emacs, org, org-trello, &#x2026;). So might as well update some of
them.
</p>

<p>
For the videos, I would like to use something simple. The result output ideally
rendered in an html page. The html rendered <a href="https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello">README.md</a> and the <a href="https://org-trello.github.io">online doc</a> are
html pages after all.
</p>

<p>
So back to basics, an animated video picture would do. I came across
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast">gif-screencast</a> which seems nice enough for my endeavor.
</p>

<p>
I also need a tool which displays what i'm currently typing. I recall <a href="https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey">screenkey</a>
was nice enough.
</p>

<p>
In the coming days, I should be able to start doing so.
