C              G                 Am          F
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
</p>

<p>
C              G                 Am          F
And in my hour of darkness, She is standing right in front of me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it be
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F  C/E Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
</p>

<p>
C              G                 Am          F
And when the broken hearted people, Living in the world agree
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be
</p>

<p>
C              G                 Am          F
But though they may be parted, There is still a chance that they will see
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be
</p>

<p>
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G                C              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G                C              F  C/E Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
</p>

<p>
Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
G                C              F  C/E Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
</p>

<p>
And when the night is cloudy, There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow, let it be
</p>

<p>
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
CHORUS
